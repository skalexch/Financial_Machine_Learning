# Financial_Machine_Learning

These notebooks were made in the contxt of a class that I had in my final engineering study year.
We worked on stock data in order to implement measures and to test trading and portfolio strategies. We used a plethora of popular Machine Learning models.
At this point I was coding with quite an ease.
Final evaluation: 18.5/20
